# `surimi` - Safe SASS validation library

Make your SCSS/SASS safer with `surimi`. Define a schema for your data and ensure users use it correctly!

- ðŸ”’ Bulletproof error-checking makes sure you (or your users) don't miss a thing!
- ðŸš€ No runtime! It's all just SCSS. You'll see the error before it's too late
- ðŸŽ­ Make it your own! All labels / prefixes can be changed to represent your library
- ðŸŒˆ Beautiful, customizable error messages
- âœ… Tested with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and the sass compiler

## installation

To use `surimi`, you gota have `sass`, `sass-embedded` or any other SASS/SCSS compiler installed. Then just

```bash
# npm
npm install -D surimi
# pnpm
pnpm add -D surimi
```

and.. that's it!

```scss
@use 'surimi' as s;

$my-number-schema: s.number(
  $gte: 18,
);

$my-string-schema: s.string(
  $min-length: '4',
  $starts-with: 'su',
  $ends-with: 'mi',
);

@include s.validate($my-number-schema, 15); // Oh-oh, an error!
@include s.validate($my-string-schema, 'tofu'); // No way!
```

You will recognize many of the properties - they are simple strings similar to 'zod' or 'yup'. And if you do put a wrong one.. We got you covered!

```
[surimi] `string.min` is not a valid validator. Allowed validators are: [eq, in, not-in, contains, not-contains, ... max-length, min-length]
    â•·
7   â”‚   $my-string-schema: s.string(
    â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€^
8   â”‚ â”‚   $min: 'su',
9   â”‚ â”‚   $ends-with: 'mi',
10  â”‚ â”‚ );
    â”‚ â””â”€^
```

All `surimi` methods are validated themselves - leaving zero room for errors. Of course, validation errors look just as nice:

```
[surimi] Value must be greater than or equal to 18
    â•·
12  â”‚ @include s.validate($my-number-schema, 15); // Oh-oh, an error!
    â”‚ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    â•µ
```

## Usage

At this time, only three simple validators are supported: `string`, `number` and `map`. We're working on extending them!

Regardless of which validator you use, pass the result into either `surimi.validate` or `surimi.validate-fn`. The first is a mixin you can use with `@include`, the second one is a function you can just call. Both receive the same arguments, with two differences:

1. When `throw` is set to `false`, the mixin will print out warnings instead. The function will **return the errors** as a list.
2. The function cannot be called without specifying a return value. That's a limitation of SCSS, and the reason the mixin exists!

In any case, the methods have no side-effects. They either just throw errors/warnings, or return the errors.
